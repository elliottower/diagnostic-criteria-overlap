"""Every ``...'' in the paper, checked against the stored artifacts of the sources cited near it.

Artifacts are read from $CITATIONS_HOME/artifacts, shared with the other papers
that cite the same works. See scripts/_artifacts.py.

This audits the manuscript directly, where `citations verify --claims claims` audits the
claims/ manifest. A quotation added to the .tex and not to the manifest is invisible to the
second and caught by the first.

What it does not catch: a quotation attributed to the wrong one of two sources cited in the
same paragraph. Matching is against every key in the neighbourhood, because the nearest key
is often not the source ("the same document restricts", "which the same paper asserts"), so
a passage present in either neighbour passes. Read the sentence for attribution.

An ellipsis is treated as omitted text: each fragment must appear, contiguity is not required.
